This project is simple, and you can run it in any environment you deem appropriate - I've used Laravel Sail for this specific project locally.

Ensure you have run 
- php artisan migrate
- php artisan db:seed --class=MealsTableSeeder

I have provided a build of the tailwind css with this in prod mode. 
Worth noting that, I've focussed more on the functionality, and made it look kind of OK, but tried to show some knowledge in that area. 

Trello planning board: ask for acces with email. Trello no longer allow public boards. 

I would have loved to include
- unit tests (were part of the initial plan, which was TDD. Chose not to for time)
- better UI, as I know I'm better than this
